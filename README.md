# 🕹️ Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It’s a fun little project I made to practice my JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills.

## ✨ Features

- Two-player mode
- Highlights the winner
- Clean and responsive UI
- Reset game anytime

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Start playing!

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – main structure
- `style.css` – styles for the game
- `game.js` – game logic (turns, win/draw check)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Writing clean and readable code
- Building simple game logic
